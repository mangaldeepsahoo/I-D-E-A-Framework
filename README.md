# 💡 I-D-E-A Framework™
### A Lean Path from Imagination to Validated MVP  
**Author:** Mangaldeep Sahoo (2025)

---

## 🧩 Overview
The **I-D-E-A Framework™** is an original product-discovery methodology that blends human creativity with data-driven validation.  
It helps Product Managers and Founders move from **raw imagination → validated MVP → iterative growth**, quickly and systematically.

## 🔄 4-Step Framework

| Step | Concept | Description | Example Tools / Methods |
|------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| **I — Imagination** | *Ideate Boldly* | Generate bold, creative ideas beyond constraints. Encourage lateral thinking and user-first imagination. | Miro · FigJam · Brainstorm Boards · AI Ideation |
| **D — Define** | *Diagnose the Real Problem* | Refine ideas into actionable problem statements based on research and data. | User Interviews · JTBD · 5 Whys · Empathy Maps |
| **E — Experiment** | *Validate with Evidence* | Test hypotheses using minimal prototypes, fake-door tests, or experiments. | Figma · A/B Testing · GA4 · Mixpanel |
| **A — Apply** | *Implement & Iterate* | Apply validated learnings to deliver the MVP. Measure impact, then iterate. | Jira · Notion · OKRs · Post-launch Analytics |

## ✅ Product Discovery Checklist

- **Imagination:** Collect user insights, brainstorm “what-if” ideas, remove constraints.  
- **Define:** Frame user problems clearly, link to measurable outcomes.  
- **Experiment:** Design MVP or landing-page tests to validate assumptions quickly.  
- **Apply:** Convert validated ideas into backlog stories and track KPI impact post-launch.

## 🚀 Example Use Case — TrackKit

**TrackKit**, an AI-driven personal-finance app, applied the I-D-E-A Framework™ to go from concept to working MVP in 4 weeks.  
The team:
1. Imagined solutions around real financial pain points.  
2. Defined core user problems (debt stress, cashflow leaks).  
3. Experimented with quick prototypes to validate hypotheses.  
4. Applied insights into a functional MVP, tracked KPIs, and iterated.
